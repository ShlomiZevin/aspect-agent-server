## General Advice on Certifications

### When a Certification IS Worth It
- It's listed in job postings as "required" or "preferred"
- It signals commitment to hiring managers who can't otherwise verify your interest
- It fills a specific technical gap

### When a Certification ISN'T Worth It
- It's a generic "leadership" or "soft skills" certification
- The field values portfolios/experience more than credentials (most creative fields)
- You're doing it to delay taking action rather than to gain real skills

### Budget Reality

- Low cost ($200–500): CompTIA, Scrum, most Google Cloud
- Mid ($500–2000): PMP, Salesforce, most professional designations
- High ($2000+): CFA, CPA, PMI, CFP — commit only if you're certain
